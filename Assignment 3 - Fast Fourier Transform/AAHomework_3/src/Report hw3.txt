Algorithms Used: Recursive Fast Fourier Transform  -- O(nlogn)

My program takes in an input of integers, interprets them as a polynomial,
inserts each case (converted to complex numbers) into an array that is a 
factor of 2 size. The array is then broken into even and odd pieces
recursively and solved via the FFT function where omega is computed on
the fly. The evens and odds are then combined to return a single Complex 
array of values that represent the evaluation of the polynomial.

I got a significant amount of help from reading the FFT example from
Princeton's website. I wouldn't have been able to complete the assignment
without that reference. The concept of an FFT took me an enormous amount of 
time to wrap my head around but having programmed it helps my understanding
quite a lot. All inputs should be within the alotted +-0.00001 error.
