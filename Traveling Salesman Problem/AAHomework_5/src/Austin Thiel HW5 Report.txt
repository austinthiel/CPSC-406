Algorithms Used : Eastman's Branch and Bound

Info: 
	I worked on this assignment completely on my own and I know 
	it's so close to fully functional but I can't find the few
	bugs in my logic. I hope you see that most of the code is
	correct and you are fair with my grade...I spent 10+
	hours on this assignment just debugging.
