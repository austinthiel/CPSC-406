Algorithms Used : Karger's Algorithm (integral of Kruskal's Algorithm)

I watched a couple videos on youtube describing Karger's algorithm and
felt it was a more elegant implementation to solve this problem. All code
was written by me alone and uses a 2D arraylist to represent the graph. It
chooses 2 random nodes to merge, re-organizes the pointers in the arraylist
to point to the newly merged node, and deletes the old node. This process
repeats until there are only 2 nodes left, then counts the number of
pointers in one of the nodes to determine the mincut. Mincut runs 
numVertices * numEdges times and takes the absolute min to ensure the
correct mincut is found.
