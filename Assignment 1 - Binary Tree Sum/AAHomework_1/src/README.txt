I attempted to complete this assignment by iterating through the string and
finding patterns with the parentheses to add each "node" to a stack and 
keeping track of the path using a stringbuilder. It was mostly successful and 
can always find the correct sequence of "nodes" if you view the output in an IDE where it 
prints the stack. However, the output of the path is not ALWAYS correct.

I used stackoverflow heavily for this assignment to remind myself of java's syntax
as I have not programmed in java for a year. Please let me know if you have any 
questions, comments, or concerns with my program. Email : thiel105@mail.chapman.edu
