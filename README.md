# algorithm-analysis

This is a compilation of my work from an Algorithm Analysis class I took while studying abroad in Korea. Each project contains a PDF explaining the problem and how inputs/outputs are structured. Each project also contains a text document in the src folder describing a few basic thoughts I had about the assignment, anti-plagiarism statements, runtime tests, etc. If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me at austin@angrydrop.net.

# tl;dr

Check out my work in the src folder of each project
