For inputs of MULTIPLE lines that are >40 points long will take a bit of time.
(about 2 minutes)

I completed this assignment entirely on my own with a bit of help from internet sources
such as stackoverflow. I didn't even think to check if there was a prebuilt library
for 2D line plotting until I was almost done with my code. If I had time, I would
rewrite this using the Line2D library. But as it is, I think it's alright.
